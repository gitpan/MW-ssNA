MW-ssNA

Perl module to calculate molecular weight of ssDNA or ssRNA.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

MODULE INFORMATION:

The input file may contain one or more sequences (should be in FASTA format).

The formulas used to calculate molecular weight of ssDNA and ssRNA are;

ssDNA : ssdna = (An * 313.2) + (Tn * 304.2) + (Gn * 329.2) + (Cn * 289.2);

ssRNA : ssrna = (An * 329.2) + (Un * 306.2) + (Gn * 345.2) + (Cn * 305.2);

where 'n' refers to the total number of occurrences. 

The option values are;

'd'	-	to find molecular weight of ssDNA

'r' 	-	to find molecular weight of ssRNA

'cd'	-	To get the total count of ATGC in DNA input sequence(s)

'cr'	-	To get the total count of AUGC in RNA input sequence(s)
